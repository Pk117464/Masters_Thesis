Sentiment Analysis (Natural Language Processing)

Research Question -

How accurate are current sentiment analysis algorithms in detecting and classifying emotions and attitudes in text?

Abstract:

Sentiment analysis has gained significant attention in recent years as an important task in natural language processing. It aims to automatically determine the underlying sentiment, emotion, or attitude expressed in a given text. The accuracy of sentiment analysis algorithms in detecting and classifying emotions and attitudes in text is a crucial factor in many applications, such as social media monitoring, product review analysis, and political sentiment analysis. This thesis investigates the current state of sentiment analysis algorithms and evaluates their accuracy in detecting and classifying emotions and attitudes in text. The study uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches to analyze the performance of different algorithms. The results show that current sentiment analysis algorithms have limitations in accurately detecting and classifying emotions and attitudes in text, especially in cases where the text includes sarcasm, irony, or ambiguity.

The main research question of this thesis is: How accurate are current sentiment analysis algorithms in detecting and classifying emotions and attitudes in text? To answer this question, the following sub-questions will be addressed:

1. What are the current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis algorithms?
2. What are the strengths and limitations of these algorithms?
3. How do these algorithms perform in detecting and classifying emotions and attitudes in text?
4. What are the factors that affect the accuracy of sentiment analysis algorithms?
5. What are the future directions for improving sentiment analysis algorithms?

Thesis Outline

The thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 1 is introduction which will introuduce the idea and background of sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis has become a critical task in natural language processing in recent years due to the increasing amount of text data available on the internet. Sentiment analysis aims to automatically determine the sentiment, emotion, or attitude expressed in a given text, such as a tweet, a product review, or a news article. The ability to automatically detect and classify emotions and attitudes in text has numerous applications, such as social media monitoring, brand reputation management, and political sentiment analysis. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the related work in sentiment analysis, including the state-of-the-art algorithms and evaluation metrics. Chapter 3 describes the methodology used in this study, including the dataset and the machine learning algorithms used for analysis. Chapter 4 presents the results of the study, including the accuracy of different sentiment analysis algorithms in detecting and classifying emotions and attitudes in text. Chapter 5 discusses the limitations of the study and suggests future directions for improving sentiment analysis algorithms. Finally, chapter 6 concludes the thesis and summarizes the main findings.
